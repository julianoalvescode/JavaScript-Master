## :books: History of JavaScript


Javascript but JS knowledge, is a high level, structured interpreted programming language with weak dynamic and multiparadigmatic typing (prototypes, object oriented, imperative and, functional).  Together with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive Web pages and is therefore an essential part of Web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to run it.

It is currently the main language for client-side programming in web browsers. It is also widely used on the server side through environments like node.js.

As a multi-paradigmatic language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles, featuring features such as closures and high-order functions commonly unavailable in popular languages such as Java and C++. I have APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as network, storage or graphical installations, relying on that in the host environment where it is embedded.

It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that scripts could run on the client side and interact with the user without the need for this script to pass through the server, controlling the browser, performing asynchronous communication and changing the content of the displayed document, but JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including servers on web servers and databases and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF, and at runtime environments that provide JavaScript for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

The terms [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/) and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any additional structure or library. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are simple JavaScript code.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including the language name, syntax, and the respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript has been influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.

It is based on ECMAScript, standardized by Ecma international in the ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262 specifications.

###  Creation in Netscape 

The Mosaic web browser was launched in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a major role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. Mosaic's leading developers founded Netscape , which launched a more sophisticated browser, Netscape Navigator , in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most widely used browser.

During those years of Web training, Web pages could only be static, without the ability to behave dynamically after loading the page in the browser. There was a desire in the growing Web development landscape to remove this limitation, so in 1995 Netscape decided to add a scripting language to the Navigator. They sought two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to incorporate the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to incorporate the Scheme language. 

Netscape management soon decided that the best option was Eich to create a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less similar to Scheme or other existing script languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were officially called LiveScript when first released as part of a Navigator version in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript three months later.

The choice of the JavaScript name caused confusion, sometimes giving the impression that it is a derivation of Java. Since Java was the new programming language of the time, this was characterized as a marketing move by Netscape to provide its own new language cache.


### Adoption by Microsoft 

Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. In front of JavaScript, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript .

JScript was first released in 1996, along with initial support for CSS and HTML extensions. Each of these implementations was visibly different from its Navigator counterparts. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of the "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.

### The rise of JScript 

In November 1996, Netscape sent JavaScript to ECMA International as a starting point for a standard specification with which all browser providers could comply. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

The standards process continued for a number of years with the launch of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 started in 2000.

Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. In the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. [18] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually stopped collaborating on ECMA's work. Thus, ECMAScript 4 was blocked.


### Growth and standardization 
During the Internet Explorer domain period in the early 2000s, the script on the client side stagnated. This began to change in 2004 when Netscape's successor, Mozilla , launched the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, gaining significant market share from Internet Explorer.

In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International and work began on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led Mozilla to work together with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems ), which was implementing E4X in the ActionScript 3 language, based on a draft of ECMAScript 4. The goal was to standardize ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the implementation of Tamarin as an open source project . However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were very different from the scripts established on the customer side, and without the cooperation of Microsoft , ECMAScript 4 never achieved success.

Meanwhile, very important developments were taking place in open source communities not affiliated to ECMA's work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create Web applications where data can be uploaded in the background, avoiding the need for a full page. reload. This sparked a period of revival of JavaScript, led by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery , Prototype , Dojo Toolkit and MooTools .

Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was the first to use just-in-time compilation, significantly improving runtimes. Other browser vendors needed to review their engines to compete.

In July 2008, these different parties met for a conference in Oslo . This led to an eventual agreement at the beginning of 2009 to combine all relevant work and boost the language. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.

### Reaching maturity 
The ambitious work on language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and improvements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.

From 2016 to 2019, a new version of the ECMAScript standard was published each year, but the scope of the changes was much smaller than the fifth or sixth edition. Therefore, JavaScript can now be considered a mature, widely established language.

The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and structures, established programming practices, and increased use of JavaScript outside of web browsers. In addition, with the emergence of single-page applications and other heavy-duty JavaScript sites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.
