## :books: History of JavaScript


Javascript but JS knowledge, is a high level, structured interpreted programming language with weak dynamic and multiparadigmatic typing (prototypes, object oriented, imperative and, functional).  Together with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive Web pages and is therefore an essential part of Web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to run it.

It is currently the main language for client-side programming in web browsers. It is also widely used on the server side through environments like node.js.

As a multi-paradigmatic language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles, featuring features such as closures and high-order functions commonly unavailable in popular languages such as Java and C++. I have APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as network, storage or graphical installations, relying on that in the host environment where it is embedded.

It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that scripts could run on the client side and interact with the user without the need for this script to pass through the server, controlling the browser, performing asynchronous communication and changing the content of the displayed document, but JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including servers on web servers and databases and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF, and at runtime environments that provide JavaScript for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

The terms [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/) and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any additional structure or library. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are simple JavaScript code.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including the language name, syntax, and the respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript has been influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.

It is based on ECMAScript, standardized by Ecma international in the ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262 specifications.
